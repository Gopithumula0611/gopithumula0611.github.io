    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Gopi Thumula</strong>, a passionate and skilled Java Full-Stack Developer based in Bridgeport, CT. With over 3 years of experience in software development, I specialize in building scalable backend systems and responsive front-end interfaces using modern technologies like Java, Spring Boot, React.js, Angular, and AWS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from <strong>Sacred Heart University</strong> (GPA: 3.8/4.0), where I also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and published research on machine learning-based malware detection at <strong>IEEE ICSPIS 2024</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally, I’ve contributed to high-impact projects at <strong>Mastercard</strong>, where I helped modernize legacy systems using microservices, React.js, and cloud-native architectures. My previous experience at <strong>Cognizant</strong> included enhancing banking platforms with secure APIs, Dockerized deployments, and real-time data processing using Kafka.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical toolkit includes Java 17, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, AWS, React, Angular, and CI/CD tools like Jenkins and CircleCI. I’m also certified as an <strong>AWS Developer Associate</strong> and <strong>Oracle Certified Java Programmer</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I'm a problem-solver who enjoys taking on challenges, optimizing systems, and contributing to innovative tech solutions. My journey—from a small farming background to building enterprise-grade systems—reflects my dedication, resilience, and hunger to grow in the tech world.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Let’s connect and build something impactful together!</strong></p>
