        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Gopi Thumula, a passionate and results-driven Java Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience in designing and building scalable, high-performance web applications. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Sacred Heart University (GPA: 3.8), where I also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and published research on machine learning-based malware detection at IEEE ICSPIS 2024.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked across diverse environments—ranging from fintech at Mastercard, academic research, and enterprise software at Cognizant—where I delivered modern web applications using Java 11/17, Spring Boot, Microservices, React.js, Angular, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

I specialize in:

End-to-end development of scalable, secure, and responsive applications

Microservices architecture, CI/CD, and cloud-native deployments

Machine Learning integration with Java-based tools for cybersecurity applications

Front-end development with modern JS frameworks like React and Angular

Collaborating in Agile/Scrum teams and mentoring peers to deliver quality software

I’m also certified as an AWS Developer Associate and an Oracle Certified Java Programmer, constantly learning and exploring new tech. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge web platforms or contributing to impactful research, I bring a blend of creativity, technical depth, and business focus to everything I do.

Let’s connect and build something amazing!
