        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m <b>Gopi Thumula</b>, a passionate and results-driven Java Full Stack Developer with over <b>4 years</b> of experience in designing and building scalable, high-performance web applications. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Sacred Heart University (GPA: 3.8), where I also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and published research on machine learning-based malware detection at IEEE ICSPIS 2024.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked across diverse environments—ranging from fintech at Mastercard, academic research, and enterprise software at Cognizant—where I delivered modern web applications using Java 11/17, Spring Boot, Microservices, React.js, Angular, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

<b>I specialize in:</b>
  <br>
<b>End-to-end development of scalable, secure, and responsive applications</b>
<br>
<b>Microservices architecture, CI/CD, and cloud-native deployments</b>
<br>
<b>Machine Learning integration with Java-based tools for cybersecurity applications</b>
<br>
<b>Front-end development with modern JS frameworks like React and Angular</b>
<br>
<b>Collaborating in Agile/Scrum teams and mentoring peers to deliver quality software</b>
<br>
I’m also certified as an AWS Developer Associate and an Oracle Certified Java Programmer, constantly learning and exploring new tech. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge web platforms or contributing to impactful research, I bring a blend of creativity, technical depth, and business focus to everything I do.

Let’s connect and build something amazing!
